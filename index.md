**Covid-19 Vaccine statistics and map on a dashboard**

This dashboard is a part of a software development project, consisting in analyzing the spread of Covid-19 disease in France with an animated map, which allows to visualize per day the deaths due to covid in the French departments.

Different graphs and gifs have been produced to illustrate how Covid-19 affects the population, for example by age (e.g. a dashboard with different statistical characteristics).
